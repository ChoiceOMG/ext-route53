This extension integrates Plesk with Amazon Route 53, a highly available and scalable DNS web service which you can use it as an external DNS service for your domains. The extension automatically synchronizes the DNS zones from Plesk to Amazon Route 53 (but not vice versa). 

You can do the following:

- See the list of Amazon name servers used to host your DNS zones and their IP addresses.
- Manage delegation sets of name servers for registered DNS zones.
- Synchronize all DNS zones information between Plesk and Amazon name servers.
- Remove all DNS zones information from Amazon name servers.
